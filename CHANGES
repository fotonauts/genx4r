[ Changes for 0.05 - Nov 25, 2004 ]

* Added GenX::Builder, which works much like Jim Weirich's Builder
  library, but filters the output through GenX, so you get the benefit
  of sanity checking.

* Fixed some bugs in the element, namespace, and attribute declaration
  code that could have resulted in spurious errors when there was nothing
  wrong.

[ Changes for 0.04 - Oct 1, 2004 ]

* Ruby 1.6.8 compatability.  Really.  I mean it this time.  Sigh.

* Update to latest genx, fixes a memory leak in genxDispose.

* Added a gemspec for RubyGems installation.

[ Changes for 0.03 - Jul 11, 2004 ]

* Use a slightly modified version of setup.rb for build/install/tests 
  instead of manually running extconf.rb for build/install and rake for
  tests.  This required a rather massive reorganization of the source
  tree.  Thank $DIETY for 'svn move' ;-)

* Don't require IO or StringIO objects for GenX::Writer#document, instead
  just require that the object responds to the #<< method.
  Suggested by Christian Neukirchen <chneukirchen at gmail.com>.

* Add #begin_document, #end_document, #begin_element, and #end_element 
  methods to GenX::Writer, since it's sometimes inconvenient to make use
  of blocks when creating documents and elements.

[ Changes for 0.02 - Jun 16, 2004 ]

* Ruby 1.6.8 compatability.

* Added CHANGES file ;-)

[ Changes for 0.01 - Jun 13, 2004 ]
